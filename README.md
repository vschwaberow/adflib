# adflib

A Rust library for managing ADF files.

## Motivation

As proceeding with cross development for the Amiga, I needed a way to manage ADF files. I found a few libraries, but none of them were written in Rust. That's the lang I wanted my tools in. So I decided to write a Rust based library for managing ADF files. The library is still in its early stages, is not yet feature complete and is not yet well tested.

It is my intention to make this library as complete as possible, so that it can be used in other projects.

The library is based on the [ADF File Format] (http://lclevy.free.fr/adflib/faq.html) specification and uses the concepts of the [ADF library] (https://github.com/lclevy/ADFlib) by Laurent Clevy which was written in 1997.

Nevertheless it is a conversion to Rust without the use of any C code or the ADF library.
## Usage

TBD

## License
